## Takeaways on lessons uptil now

### Spreadsheets
### Python
One can assign a value to a variable in Python. Those variables can be of several types, such as string, integer, floating point and complex numbers.  
  
Python Data structures:  
 * list: another_list = ["blue", "green", "red"] - Lists contains an ordered sequence of elements. Each element can be accessed by an index. 
 * tuple: another_tuple = ("blue", "green", "red") - Tuples are order lists of elements, but immutable
 * Dictionary: another_dict = {'first': 'one', 'second': 'two', 'third': 'three'} - Dictionaries are data structures that provide mappings between keys and values
  
Libraries enable us to extend the functionality of Python.  

### Pandas
    
A Dataframe is a Pandas data structure that allows one to access data by column (name or index) or row.

Aggregating data using the groupby() function enables you to generate useful summaries of data quickly.



    In Python, portions of data can be accessed using indices, slices, column headings, and condition-based subsetting.

    Python uses 0-based indexing, in which the first element in a list, tuple or any other data structure has an index of 0.

    Pandas enables common data exploration steps such as data indexing, slicing and conditional subsetting.


    Matplotlib is the engine behind plotnine and Pandas plots.

    The object-based nature of matplotlib plots enables their detailed customization after they have been created.

    Export plots to a file using the savefig method.




Working with tabular datafile in python, best package for that is pandas. 
Important features in pandas: subsetting dataframes , grouping , combining dataframes
