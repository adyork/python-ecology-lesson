A version control system stores a master copy of your code in a repository,
which you can't edit directly. 

Instead, you checkout a working copy of the code,
edit that code,
then commit changes back to the repository.

In this way,
the system records a complete revision history (i.e. of every commit),
so that you can retrieve and compare previous versions at any time.

This is useful from an individual viewpoint,
because you don't need to store multiple (but slightly different) copies of the same script.

![File mess](../fig/05-git-file-mess.gif)

It's also useful from a collaboration viewpoint
(including collaborating with yourself across different computers)
because the system keeps a record of who made what changes and when.


## Setup

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. 

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "you@email.com"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](http://github.com/),
[BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](http://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server later on in this lesson will include this information.

You only need to run these configuration commands once -
git will remember then for next time.

We then need to navigate to our `data-carpentry` directory
and tell Git to initialise that directory as a Git repository.

~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop/data-carpentry
$ git init
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
data/					script_template.py
plot_precipitation_climatology.py
~~~
{: .output}

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `data-carpentry` called `.git`:

~~~
$ ls -F -a
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
./					data/
../					plot_precipitation_climatology.py
.git/				script_template.py
~~~
{: .output}

Git stores information about the project in this special sub-directory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	data/
	plot_precipitation_climatology.py
	script_template.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

## Tracking changes

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file/s in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

~~~
$ git add plot_precipitation_climatology.py
~~~
{: .bash}

and then check that the right thing happened:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   plot_precipitation_climatology.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	data/
	script_template.py
~~~
{: .output}

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `plot_precipitation_climatology.py`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Initial commit of precip climatology script"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master (root-commit) 32b1b66] Initial commit of precip climatology script
 1 file changed, 121 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 plot_precipitation_climatology.py
~~~
{: .output}

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a commit (or revision)
and its short identifier is `32b1b66`
(Your commit may have another identifier.)

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

If we run `git status` now:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	data/
	script_template.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

~~~
$ git log
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
commit 32b1b664a647abbbe46a12ce98b25fa2cbbb7c76
Author: Damien Irving <my@email.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 18 14:30:16 2017 +1100

    Initial commit of precip climatology script
~~~
{: .output}

`git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

Let's go ahead and open our favourite text editor and
make a small change to `plot_precipitation_climatology.py`
by editing the `description` variable
(which is used by argparse in the help information it displays at the command line).

~~~
description='Plot the precipitation climatology for a given season.'
~~~
{: .language-python}

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   plot_precipitation_climatology.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	data/
	script_template.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

~~~
$ git diff
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
$ git diff
diff --git a/plot_precipitation_climatology.py b/plot_precipitation_climatology.
index 056b433..a0aa9e4 100644
--- a/plot_precipitation_climatology.py

@@ -99,7 +99,7 @@ def main(inargs):

+    description='Plot the precipitation climatology for a given season.'
     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=description)
     
     parser.add_argument("pr_file", type=str,
~~~

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `056b433` and `a0aa9e4` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Small improvement to help information"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
	modified:   plot_precipitation_climatology.py

Untracked files:
	data/
	script_template.py

no changes added to commit
~~~
{: .output}

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

~~~
$ git add plot_precipitation_climatology.py
$ git commit -m "Small improvement to help information"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master 444c3c0] Small improvement to help information
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
~~~
{: .output}

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we're writing our thesis using LaTeX
(the plain text `.tex` files can be tracked using Git)
and we add a few citations
to the introduction chapter.
We might want to commit those additions to our `introduction.tex` file
but *not* commit the work we're doing on the `conclusion.tex` file
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current changeset but not yet committed.

> ## Staging Area
>
> If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
> `git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot

![The Git Staging Area](../fig/05-git-staging-area.svg)

Let's do the whole edit-add-commit process one more time to
watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area
and into long-term storage.
First,
we'll tweak the section of the script that imports all the libraries we need,
by putting them in the order suggested by the
[PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports)
(standard library imports, related third party imports, then local application/library specific imports):

## Exploring history

As we saw earlier, we can refer to commits by their identifiers.
You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

To demonstrate how to use `HEAD`,
let's make a trival change to `plot_precipitation_climatology.py`
by inserting a comment.

~~~
# A random comment
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now, let's see what we get.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD plot_precipitation_climatology.py
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
diff --git a/plot_precipitation_climatology.py b/plot_precipitation_climatology.
index 29a40fb..344a34e 100644

 import cmocean
 
+# A random comment
 
 def convert_pr_units(darray):
     """Convert kg m-2 s-1 to mm day-1.

~~~
{: .output}

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).
The real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits. 
We do that by adding `~1` to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD~1 plot_precipitation_climatology.py
~~~
{: .bash}

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~2`, `HEAD~3`, and so on, to refer to them.

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit
as well as the commit message,
rather than the _differences_ between a commit and our working directory.

~~~
$ git show HEAD~1 plot_precipitation_climatology.py

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our second commit was given the ID
`444c3c045dc69a323e40d4a04813b88e4b89e05e`,
but you only have to use the first seven characters
for git to know what you mean:

~~~
$ git diff 444c3c0 plot_precipitation_climatology.py

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changedâ€”now how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:

~~~
$ echo "whoops" > plot_precipitation_climatology.py
$ cat plot_precipitation_climatology.py
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
whoops
~~~
{: .output}

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   plot_precipitation_climatology.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	data/
	script_template.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

We can put things back the way they were at the time of our last commit
by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout HEAD plot_precipitation_climatology.py
$ cat plot_precipitation_climatology
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
import argparse
import numpy
...
~~~
{: .output}

As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.

We've lost the random comment that we inserted
(that change hadn't been committed)
but everything else is there.
